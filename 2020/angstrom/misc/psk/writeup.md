The description says "My friend sent my yet another mysterious recording... He told me he was inspired by PicoCTF 2019 and made his own transmissions. I've looked at it, and it seems to be really compact and efficient. Only 31 bps!!". The name of the challenge is PSK which stands for Phase Shift Keying and after looking more into it it has a ton of different modes. One of the modes is PSK-31 which seems like what the description is referencing. 

PSK31 is used to transmit ASCII text in a sound format. This challenge just took a lot of looking for tools, I found FLDigi which can read a .wav file and output the ascii. I ran it and got the flag simple as that. I wish that the challenge didn't just rely on finding the right tool.

Flag: actf{hamhamhamhamham}
